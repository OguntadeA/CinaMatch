We as members, contributors, and leaders of the 305Soft community pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community  
- Being on time and showing up to every scheduled class or team meeting unless you have a valid excuse (see “Attendance” below)

## 305Soft Additional Collaboration Guidelines

To foster productive teamwork and high-quality collaboration, 305Soft members agree to the following policies:

1. **No Distracted Use of Technology**  
   - Phones, messaging apps, and other personal electronic devices must be silenced and put away during all team meetings or collaborative working sessions.  
   - Laptops and tablets should only be used for meeting-related tasks.

2. **Decision Making**  
   - **Method**: Major decisions will be made by Majority vote   
   - **Process**: Members will discuss topics, hear differing viewpoints, and work toward a group decision.  
   - **Tie-Breakers / Final Authority**: If a decision remains deadlocked, the scrum manger will decide

3. **Attendance**  
   - **Expectations**: Members are expected to attend all scheduled team meetings on time.  
   - **Legitimate Reasons for Absence**: Career development events, family issues, documented illness, or emergencies. (See “Rules for Valid Excuses.”)  
   - **Make-Up Work**: Absent members must review meeting notes, ask clarifying questions, and complete any assigned tasks before the next class period
   - **Notification**: If you must miss or be late, please notify the team through text as soon as possible.

4. **Assignments**  
   - **Task Allocation**: Assignments will be distributed by the scrum leader considering individual strengths and interests.  
   - **Completion and Quality**: Members are expected to complete tasks on time and at a high standard.  
   - **Non-Compliance**: If someone repeatedly fails to complete tasks or submits poor-quality work, the team will either specify the steps for resubmission: discuss privately, redistribute tasks, contact instructor, etc.

5. **Participation**  
   - **Communication Channels**: We will use text message for regular communication and file sharing.  
   - **Inclusive Engagement**: Everyone should have the opportunity to speak, ask questions, and share ideas.  
   - **Leveraging Strengths**: Tasks should be balanced in a way that leverages each member’s strengths while also allowing growth in new areas.

6. **Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums**  
   - **Scheduling**: The team will collectively decide on meeting times that suit all members, ensuring maximum availability.  
   - **Mediums**: Meetings may be in-person or virtual through Zoom. If virtual, ensure all participants can connect adequately.

7. **Agenda, Minutes, and Notes**  
   - **Agenda**: An agenda will be shared during each class period
   - **Note-Taker**: A note taker assigned each day will be responsible for taking and sharing minutes.  
   - **Distribution**: Notes should be shared promptly after each meeting in the Github repository

8. **Promptness**  
   - **Expectations**: Arrive on time and be prepared with any pre-meeting work completed.  
   - **Handling Lateness**: Chronic lateness or last-minute cancellations should be addressed with the scrum master or professor if necessary

9. **Conversational Courtesies**  
   - **Active Listening**: Listen attentively when others speak and avoid interrupting.  
   - **Balanced Airtime**: Ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute; be mindful not to dominate the conversation.  
   - **Respectful Dialogue**: Maintain professionalism and courtesy in all discussions; keep tangents or off-topic remarks to a minimum.

10. **Enforcement / Feedback**  
   - **Self-Enforcement**: Team members are expected to respectfully remind each other of these guidelines if they are not being followed.  
   - **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts arise, the team will discuss them promptly and, if needed, seek mediation from the instructor
   - **Feedback**: Members agree to give and receive feedback in a timely, respectful manner, focusing on specific behaviors and outcomes.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (and the 305Soft team, as relevant) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the above standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
