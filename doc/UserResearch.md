**Observation 1: Ayishat**
- **Observation Statement**: A large majority of users are between the ages of 18-24, and the gender of our users are equal therefore this will affect the UI/UX design of the app.
- **Supporting Data**: From the quiz, I found that 92.5 percent of people are between the ages of 18-24. Also 45.3 percent of users are female, and 49.1 percent are males, and 5.7 percent are nonbinary. 
- **Team Action (if any):** Design a UI tailored to Gen Z/Millennials, focusing on modern aesthetics, dark mode, personalization, mobile-first optimization, and inclusivity.

**Observation 2: Roquibat** <br>
- **Observation Statement:** A large number of people find that the genre is the most important factor when it comes to deciding a movie. This factor shows that the implementation of letting the users filter what they want to watch by genre plays a crucial role in the user experience when using the app. 
- **Supporting Data:** 84.9% (45 out of 53) responses show that the users find this aspect and way of filtering a key factor amongst others when choosing a movie or TV-show to watch. 
- **Team Action (if any):** Prioritize implementing in filtering by genre to ensure convenience for users in app experience

**Observation 3: John Cullinane** <br>
- **Observation Statement:** A large majority of the respondents report that they solely rely on memory to keep track of the shows/movies they want to watch. Respondents also frequently respond saying that they are overwhelmed by the large amount of shows/movies available to them. This indicates that people may struggle to remember all the shows and movies they want to watch and that they could benefit from a watch list, but may not have used one before.
- **Supporting Data:** 67.9% of respondents reported “I rely on memory” to how they keep track of shows and movies, and 69.8% of respondents reported that they would be either ‘Very likely’ or ‘Somewhat likely’ to use a feature that allowed them to create a watch list for movies and TV shows.
- **Team Action (if any):** Given that nearly 70% of respondents expressed interest in such a feature, our team could focus on creating an intuitive and accessible design that encourages users to easily add, organize, and access their watch list.

**Observation 4: Kishan**
- **Observation Statement**: A large number of respondents want a way to filter movies and tv shows based on the streaming services that they have. 
- **Supporting Data:** 79.2% of respondents responded “yes” to the question “Would you like to filter recommendations based on the streaming services you are subscribed to?”
- **Team Action (if any):** Ensure that there is a filtering option for users to pick and filter the movie and tv show recommendations based on streaming services that the user has.

**Observation 5: Zachary**
- **Observation Statement**: People are very interested in a feature that would allow them to share watchlists with their friends. This is an even larger portion of interest than the basic watchlist feature. 
- **OSupporting Data:**< 73.6% are either Very Likely or Somewhat likely to use this feature. 13.2% are neutral, and the remaining 13.2% are unlikely to use it.  This shows that the majority of respondents are in strong support of the feature. 
- **OTeam Action (if any):** We must ensure that created recommendation watchlists have the ability to be shared with other users in as seamless a way as possible. This could present itself in the form of a shareable link, or text message, so that it can be accessed on as many platforms as possible.
