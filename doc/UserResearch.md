**Observation 3: John Cullinane** <br>
<br>**Observation Statement:**<br> A large majority of the respondents report that they solely rely on memory to keep track of the shows/movies they want to watch. Respondents also frequently respond saying that they are overwhelmed by the large amount of shows/movies available to them. This indicates that people may struggle to remember all the shows and movies they want to watch and that they could benefit from a watch list, but may not have used one before.
<br>**Supporting Data:**<br> 67.9% of respondents reported “I rely on memory” to how they keep track of shows and movies, and 69.8% of respondents reported that they would be either ‘Very likely’ or ‘Somewhat likely’ to use a feature that allowed them to create a watch list for movies and TV shows.
<br>**Team Action (if any):**<br> Given that nearly 70% of respondents expressed interest in such a feature, our team could focus on creating an intuitive and accessible design that encourages users to easily add, organize, and access their watch list.
